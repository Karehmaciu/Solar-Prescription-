## Key Difference

**Your existing approach:**
- Shows ONE specific product (hardcoded in products.json)
- SL1210 for 10W, specific models for other sizes
- Detailed specs for that ONE product

**My addition:**
- Shows MULTIPLE products that match their needs
- Filters 183 VeraSol products by coverage in their location
- Shows 6 best matches with coverage percentages

## How They Work Together
