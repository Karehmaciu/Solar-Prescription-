### User Guide: Solar Prescription Tool

#### **1. What is the Solar Prescription Tool?**

Welcome! This tool is designed to help you make smart decisions about buying a small solar home system. It acts like a doctor for your energy needs, giving you a "prescription" that tells you if a specific solar kit will work for you in your *exact* location.

It uses real-world solar data from NASA to predict how much power a kit will generate, even during cloudy seasons, and compares that to the energy your appliances use.

#### **2. Two Ways to Get Your Prescription**

The app offers two main paths, depending on what you want to find out:

**Path A: Evaluate a Specific Kit (Using "Get my prescription")**

*   **Use this if:** You already have a specific solar kit in mind (e.g., you're looking at a 100W kit in a store) and you want to know if it's powerful enough for your needs.
*   **How it works:** You select the kit size, add your appliances, and the app tells you if that kit is a good, borderline, or bad match.

**Path B: Find Out What You Need (Using "Calculate for Me")**

*   **Use this if:** You don't know what size kit you need and you want the app to recommend the minimum size required to power your appliances.
*   **How it works:** You add your appliances, and the app calculates the smallest standard-size kit that should meet your energy needs, based on your location's weather.

#### **3. Step-by-Step Instructions**

**Step 1: Enter Your Location**
This is the most important step! Start typing your town or city name in the "Location" box and select the correct one from the list. This ensures the calculations use accurate local solar data.

**Step 2: Add Your Appliances**
Tell the tool what you want to power.
*   Click on common items like "Phone Charger," "LED Lights," or "Small Fan" to add them to your list.
*   Use the `+` and `-` buttons to set the **quantity** of each device. The daily hours of use are pre-set based on typical usage and cannot be changed.

**Step 3: Choose Your Path**

*   **To Evaluate a Kit:** Click on one of the kit sizes (e.g., 50W, 100W, 200W). The button will change to say **"Get my prescription."**
*   **To Get a Recommendation:** Do not select a kit size. Instead, click the **"Calculate for Me"** button.

**Step 4: Choose Your Desired Coverage**
This tells the tool how reliable you need your power to be, especially during bad weather.

*   **50% (Budget):** Good for sunny seasons, but you will likely have power shortages during the worst weather months.
*   **70% (Balanced):** A good middle ground. You'll have reliable power for most of the year, with some shortages possible in the worst weather.
*   **90% (Premium):** The most reliable option. This system is designed to provide consistent power year-round.

**Step 5: Get Your Results!**
Click the main button ("Get my prescription" or "Calculate for Me") to see your personalized analysis.

#### **4. Understanding Your Results**

The results page gives you a detailed breakdown. Here’s what to look for:

*   **The Main Verdict:** A clear, color-coded message at the top tells you if the kit is a good match.
    *   **Approved (Green):** The kit is a good fit for your needs.
    *   **Warning (Yellow):** The kit will work most of the time but may struggle in bad weather.
    *   **Not Recommended (Red):** The kit is too small. You will likely run out of power often.
*   **Our Recommendation:** If you used "Calculate for Me" or if the kit you chose is undersized, the tool will suggest a specific kit size that is a better fit.
*   **Coverage Explanation:** This card explains what you can expect based on the 50%, 70%, or 90% coverage you chose.
*   **Certified Range Warning:** If the recommended kit is larger than 160W, a warning will appear. This means the kit is outside the range of products that have been officially certified by VeraSol, so you should be extra careful to check the manufacturer's specifications.
*   **Detailed Numbers:** You can see exactly how much energy you need, how much the kit is expected to produce in your area (on average and in the worst month), and more.

That's it! You can always go back and try different appliances or coverage levels to see how it changes your prescription.
